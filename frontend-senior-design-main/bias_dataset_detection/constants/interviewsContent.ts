## **Introduction**

As part of our project, we wanted to use our tool on our own university, The University of Texas at Austin. We ran the university’s enrollment and graduation data through our system and created a summary of statistics from our results. We interviewed individuals who are part of organizations that support underrepresented groups at UT, and presented the summary of statistics. We then asked for their thoughts on the statistics and asked them a few questions about their organizations’ initiatives to support underrepresented groups. The primary purpose of this human study was to show how student  groups at The University of Texas at Austin encourage diversity and highlight the impact these organizations have on underrepresented students. Furthermore, we concluded the study by asking participants their thoughts on the recent push for AI in university admissions. 


## **Summary of Statistics**

To provide some more context as to what the participants of the study were shown, this section details the results from UT’s enrollment and graduation data. Shown below are the results from the analysis on UT’s enrollment and graduation data:

## **Initial Reactions from the Data**

We asked each of the participants what they thought about the results generated by our system. More specifically, we showed them the data to explain the goal of our study and see if it represents their own personal experiences. All the participants we interviewed had varied reactions to the statistics generated by our system, but most of them weren’t surprised by the results. 

“I’m not 100% surprised” was an NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) member’s reaction after seeing that Black and African American students were significantly underrepresented at UT compared to schools in the region and in the nation. He detailed his personal experiences and how in his classes he rarely sees more than 2 Black or African American students. We then asked about what he thinks might be the reason for the underrepresentation. “Black and African American students want to know they’re going to a place where there are students like them. Since UT might not have as many African American students they may not want to attend UT because they may be one of few [students who have similar background and experiences] at the university”. He also brought up the point that the “city population is higher in Dallas and Houston and [universities in those areas] might have a higher population of African Americans than Austin''.

An officer of WECE (Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering) who we interviewed was not surprised by the fact that our data reflected there has been a rise in women’s enrollment over time at the university. From her own personal experience, she pointed out how most of the co-ed orgs she’s involved in have more women than men. She has also worked as a college advisor and noted that many women prefer UT as a school for higher education when compared to other Universities in the region. Another WECE officer mentioned that she wasn’t particularly surprised by the rise in enrollment due to the high number of support groups for women at the University. She thinks that is a factor that may be appealing to prospective female students. Other similar support groups for women she’s seen at UT besides WECE include Women in CS, Women in Medicine, and all women dorms and organizations.

“I’m surprised by how UT compares to the regional percentage” is what the president of SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) had to say about the lower enrollment rate of Hispanic students at UT compared to the regional enrollment rate. From his personal experience, he had felt like UT’s Hispanic student population would be higher or around the same as its neighboring schools. He had the same reaction when he saw that the graduation rate of Hispanic students at UT was lower than the regional average as well. When asked about why he thinks UT might have a lower Hispanic population compared to the regional average, he said it may be due to the fact that UT is a difficult school to get into. He went on to add that in the Hispanic community older generations may not see higher education as much of a priority, and that might result in less Hispanic students trying to apply to UT. Furthermore, from his personal experience he has noticed that most Hispanic students are first-generation college students and that might account for the lower 4-year graduation rate. “Lots of Hispanics are first generation students and they need to break a lot of barriers and struggle in college so that might account for the lower 4 year graduation rate. That’s something other groups may not be able to relate to as much”.

An officer of SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers) was surprised to see how high the enrollment of Asians was at UT. “UT is a school where you promote and value all types of ethnicities and identities. It has a very welcoming culture to different identities and perspectives”. She detailed experiences from her friends about colleges in the region that aren’t as inclusive or diverse as UT. Some of her friends at these other universities have experienced racism. She also went on to add that the highly selective and competitive nature of UT admissions might play a role in the overrepresentation. She adds how Asian culture oftentimes values education and familial pressure might play a role in Asian students being more competitive applicants. Moreover, she speculated that the higher four-year graduation rate might be due to the same factors.  


## **How are individuals and organizations at UT being more inclusive and encouraging diversity?**

After presenting our results, we wanted to see how the participants’ organizations are supporting underrepresented students and encouraging diversity at the university. The participants we interviewed are heavily involved in activities and events that aspire to increase diversity in enrollment and support students of diverse backgrounds currently enrolled at the university. 


### SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers)

SHPE is a national organization dedicated to supporting Hispanic engineering students and has over 245 chapters across the nation. UT’s SHPE chapter does a lot of outreach and supports Hispanic students in engineering. We talked to the president of SHPE and he mentioned how they do K-12 outreach by going to schools and talking about engineering at UT. They also provide students with information about the engineering program. He mentioned that the goal with outreach is to increase Hispanic students in STEM fields, and boost representation at universities and in the professional world. The SHPE president had this to say when we asked him if he thinks outreach efforts at SHPE have been successful: “I’ve heard many stories of people joining [engineering at UT and SHPE] because they were introduced to SHPE in K-12”. He goes on to add, “our goal is to increase outreach and influence [Hispanic] students to attend higher education and secure their dream job''. In addition to outreach, SHPE provides a lot of support for the students in the organization to grow professionally and socially. Since around “95-99% of the members are undergrad” according to the SHPE president, this aspect of the organization is essential. Some of the ways in which SHPE offers resources and support to these students include academic events, initiatives, weekly office hours for students, mentor programs with professionals and other students. He added that “the goal of the organization [at the university level] is to provide a sense of community where [Hispanic students] are able to trust each other and fit in with others”.


### NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers)

NSBE is a national organization whose motto is: _To increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community_. UT’s chapter of NSBE does a lot of outreach to increase enrollment for Black and African American students in engineering at UT. As reflected in the data, Black and African Americans are an underrepresented group at the University overall, and as a result in the school of engineering Black and African American students are even more underrepresented. To help increase Black and African American student enrollment at UT, NSBE does a lot of volunteer work at different schools to encourage younger Black and African American students to consider engineering as a potential career. NSBE organizes engineering competitions and activities for the kids to partake in. Moreover, to support students already enrolled at the university NSBE does a lot of work to create a safe space for Black and African American students. Study nights, mental health nights, setting up mentors, and helping people make professional connections are all ways in which NSBE tries to support students in the org. 


### WECE (Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering)

Although enrollment for women has increased overall at UT, women are still underrepresented in UT’s electrical and computer engineering program. WECE has plenty of outreach events to boost enrollment of women in the electrical and computer engineering program. Volunteers will often go to high schools or middle schools for outreach. They often set up games for kids to understand how fun engineering can be. Another big outreach event they are heavily involved in is Girl Day at the Cockrell School of Engineering. The WECE officer we interviewed added that the outreach is meant to “diffuse the stereotype [women can’t be engineers] as soon as possible”, and “having these orgs reach out to high schoolers does help show that there’s a community here”. WECE is also big on supporting women in the electrical and computer engineering program at UT. “We have a lot of social events to grow and come together as a community and rant about different things.” She mentioned an example where if a member feels like she is being talked down to at a job or internship or even in classes, she may feel comfortable to talk about it with others in the organization who may have gone through a similar experience. The officer went on to add that when she goes to her classes for the first time, the first thing she does is try to “count the number of girls in a class” so she can feel more comfortable knowing that she’s not the only woman in the class. On the other hand, at WECE events and meetings she always feels safe and comfortable because there’s more women present who share the same experiences as her. She added that “WECE is the only reason I’m still in the major” because of the sense of community the organization provides. 


### SEEK (Student Engineers Educating Kids)

SEEK is an organization where engineering students at UT will go to different K-12 schools to host engineering activities and events. The goal of this outreach is to boost an interest in engineering amongst younger students. We were able to interview the president of SEEK and she provided a lot of insightful information about the program. “SEEK works primarily with Title I schools, where over 40% of the students come from low-income backgrounds. In Austin, this means that many of the students we work with are Hispanic”. She went on to add that “the schools SEEK works with have a relatively even gender ratio, especially in the schools where [they] work with Communities in Schools Central Texas to implement SEEK as a weekly after-school program”. This is especially important because the number of women in engineering is much lower than men in engineering, especially in higher education and industry.  \
“When all the successful engineers you see in the news and in the history books are men, it’s easy to be discouraged and see engineering as a field for men to succeed in”. The president went on to add that “even when companies make DEI efforts in hiring, this often doesn’t extend down to the levels of creating equity in education, where it’s really needed to boost numbers later on down the line when companies seek to hire in the workforce”. She acknowledged that “specialized efforts are more effective” for older female students in high school but at the lower levels of education like elementary school “it’s good to cast a wider net” for female students to learn and grow skills for engineering. According to the officer, the biggest impact SEEK has seen on students is “in the students who already had some interest in engineering since they learned more”, but it’s heartening to see “even the kids who weren’t particularly interested in STEM… get excited about and completely engage with the project they’re working on”. SEEK also works with other organizations like SHPE and UChEW (Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Women) to recruit volunteers for outreach to increase diversity among the mentors. 


### DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) for the Cockrell School of Engineering

The primary purpose of Cockrell’s DEI office is to promote diversity and a safe atmosphere at the Cockrell school of engineering. We were lucky enough to get an interview with the Associate Dean of DEI at the Cockrell School of Engineering, Dr. Julien. Her responsibilities include implementing DEI at the school, allocating resources for diversity, and K-12 outreach. Some of the outreach she has been involved in includes holding engineering summer camps for kids to encourage kids of all backgrounds to develop an interest in engineering. Another example of outreach in DEI is holding information sessions at schools to inform people about decisions to make in high school and classes to take. Furthermore, DEI has a climate survey that’s sent out to students, faculty, and staff asking about the environment in the school of engineering. The purpose of the surveys is to identify ways to improve diversity and inclusion at UT in the future.

As part of our conversation on outreach, we asked her how to best target outreach efforts so that underrepresented groups are most benefited. She noted that in her experience, having students self-select themselves for these programs is not the best way to encourage participation from underrepresented communities. In a camp in Houston, DEI reached out to school counselors to handpick students who they thought would be good fits for the camp but maybe would not sign up for it themselves. Dr. Julien said that when they surveyed students before and after the camp, students that were handpicked had a much greater percentage increase in interest in engineering compared to students who signed up themselves. Additionally, the students that were handpicked usually came from more underrepresented backgrounds compared to those who signed up themselves. We also discussed this with the SEEK president, and she said that schools where teachers tell specific students to sign up typically have more girls in their SEEK sessions compared to schools where students sign up themselves.


### SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers)

SASE is a professional and social organization. For the professional side they have a lot of recruiting related events to build your career. For instance, they offer internship opportunities, interview tips, have guest speakers, and more. On the social side, there are numerous social events to help all the members gain a sense of community and belonging amongst peers of similar backgrounds and identities. Study sessions are an example of an event SASE has to encourage students to meet each other or meet other students in the org that may share the same major as them. “The main goal is to provide a community for Asian scientists and engineers to get to know each other, learn together, struggle together, a place to gain professional opportunities, etc.” as described by a SASE officer. She went on to say that having a support system is extremely important at UT and SASE provides that to Asian students. 


## **Thoughts on AI in University Admissions**

To conclude our human study we wanted to ask the participants about their thoughts on including AI in University Admissions. Our project was inspired by recent talk on how AI may be used in university admissions soon, and we were curious to see what the participants’ thoughts were on the matter. There were a wide range of perspectives on this matter from our interviewees. 

“It scares me” was Dr. Julien’s first reaction to our question. She had heard about these considerations because she’s very familiar with the admissions process. “We have no idea what’s going to happen” and she adds that it’s “very easy to bias the model by the dataset you train it on”. “If there has been systemic bias in an admissions system for decades and we use the profile of our previous students to train the model then we are including previous bias in admissions”. She refuses to see the use of AI in university admissions as an inevitability and added that “we need to be careful about more nuanced things that a human may be able to look at but a machine may not”. Similarly, a WECE officer added that she thinks it's better to keep the human touch in admissions. “People fear admissions being based on just statistics or an essay” and she adds that “AI may be able to filter out some people” but making sure people have final say would be important. 

On the other hand, a few individuals we interviewed thought there might be some potential benefits to using AI in university admissions. A NSBE member we interviewed added that personally he thinks AI “could lead to a net positive effect”. He thinks AI could increase overall percentages of underrepresented groups at the university. He did acknowledge the fact that it would depend on how many applicants are in the pool and thinks outreach efforts will definitely aid that process. The president of SHPE also thought the inclusion of AI could potentially raise the number of underrepresented groups in certain majors at UT, e.g. Hispanic students in engineering. He also added that AI could possibly have a more explainable approach to university admissions, and having this explainable aspect could make the admissions process more transparent. 

AI in university admissions is a recent consideration and only time will tell how it may impact university admissions and demographics overall. What we know for certain is that there are numerous individuals and organizations at different universities, similar to those seen in this human study at UT Austin, working to increase diversity in university enrollment and support underrepresented students. Our hope is that our system will also aid in the effort to increase diversity in university enrollment by helping universities understand and address biases in their admissions.
